#tab1 (NAoffspringremoved_individuals)
Data in wide format (each row has mother and father ID and loads for individual offspring) 
all NA offspring removed,85 families left
need this wide format to calculate mean offspring load (offspring with N.D. removed from mean calculation)

#tab2 (85fam_NAoffspringrem_class)
Data in long format (i.e. all individuals organised by class so no repeats of mother or father ID/loads)
85 families organised by class to calculate offspring count per family, GAVtve count and GAV-ve counts
* But to calculate mean offspring load, must remove all N.D. offspring, so create a new tab for this later

#tab3 (32fams_class_5offspring)
Data in long format
Narrow down criteria to minimum 5 offspring per family
Now I have 32 families left.
Add columns for fatherld,motherld,offspring count, offspringmeanld (leave blank for now), GAVtve and GAV-ve(i.e. ND counts) 

#tab4
Only include families from the 32 fam, >5offspring list (tab3)

Before calculating the mean offspring family loads per 32 families in wide format , remove all ND offspring values 

** Do not include any ND offspring values for the mean offspring loads per family 

Functionsyntax =AVERAGEIF(B$2:B$448,J2,F$2:F$448)

Copy the mean offspring values into tab 3.
